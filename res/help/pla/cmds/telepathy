\h TELEPATHY \d

\uUSAGE\n
telepathy name message

\uDESCRIPTION\n
Send a private message to a person with whom you have established a two-way telepathic link.

Telepathic communication must be kept In-Character (IC) at all times.

\uEMOTES\n
You can send an emote in a telepathic message. Emotes must begin with a \l#x\d. As with the "emote" command, you may optionally specify where your character's name should appear using \l#e\d. For example, if you type \qtelepathy hanako \l#x\qgives you his full attention\d, Hanako's player will see the following (assuming your name is Taro):
[Taro] [Taro gives you his full attention.]

Notice how in the above example we have \l#x\qgives you\d, as opposed to \l#x\qgives \l#r\qhanako\d. It is legal to use forms of the word "you" in emotes here and, as there is only one possible target, there is no need for "#rhanako".

\uEXPRESSIVE COMMANDS\n
You can send an expressive command in a telepathic message. Expressive commands must begin with a \l#p\d. For example, if you type \qtelepathy hanako \l#p\qcomfort\d, Hanako's player will see the following (assuming your name is Taro):
[Taro] <Taro comforts you.>

Notice how in the above example we have just \l#p\qcomfort\d, as opposed to \l#p\qcomfort hanako\d. Due to the fact that the "comfort" expressive command requires a target, and there is only one possible target in this case, the name may be omitted.

The use of emotes and expressive commands in telepathic communication is explained IC as being the telepathic projection of thoughts, feelings, and images.
